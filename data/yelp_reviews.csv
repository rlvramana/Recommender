Firefox&CMChicken,"Their spice levels are no joke. SO GOOD THOUGH. 

Unfortunately, original was too spicy for the little one, but she never eats spice lol. It definitely has a kick. 

The rest of the flavors scale up from 1-5 pretty quick. 

Original is great. Garlic soy is my favorite.",real
Firefox&CMChicken,"Nom nom nom. Located in SE Grand Rapids, MI! 

Service: 9/10
Food: 10/10
Cost: 9.5/10

Reminds me of Bonchon chicken or Noori chicken. THEIR BREADING IS SO GOOD. KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN BREADING SLAPS. I would probably eat here everyday if I could. 

Many comfort foods but also coming in hot with the chicken. 

We spent $26 for a 10 piece, 2 side radishes, a side of rice and two water bottles.",real

Firefox&CMChicken,"FIRE. LITERALLY. we got the red pepper and spicy garlic. We drove back for ""regular"" chicken because I couldn't let pookie's first time trying bomb ahh chicken to be unenjoyable. Soo we got soy garlic. still a little on the MILD side, probably should've gotten original, but it was all still so good. I'm so glad I found it on yelp and was not expecting it to be Korean chicken but bam. And dicked pickled radish. Double bam. Fuego. Literally. Again. Otra vez. 10/10. Driving 40 minutes for some similar-to Bonchon Chicken. Definutely looked nice inside, the cashier was so nice and precious . We did not eat inside for the sake of time but would when we have a chance to. Thank you FireFox!",real
Firefox&CMChicken,"While visiting Grand Rapids with my family, we stumbled upon Firefox & CM Chicken. We figured we couldn't go wrong with Korean fried chicken and thankfully, we were not disappointed. Since my mom avoids spicy foods, we wanted to be sure we didn't order anything too spicy and the lady taking our order was very helpful and assisted us with ordering foods that were mild enough for her.

Since we wanted to try a few different flavors, we decided on the Garlic Soy Chicken Drums, Curry Chicken Wings, Veggie Fried Rice and Fries. The menu included something that was intriguing to us called the Snow Onion so we definitely had to try that out as well.

The food was ready fairly quickly and tasted amazing. The Garlic Soy and Curry had a very minimal spice level. The chicken was fried to perfection and the flavors were phenomenal. We chose the Snow Onion with the chicken tenders and it was one of the best things I've ever tasted. The sweet onions were sliced very thinly and were smothered in a lightly sweetened sauce. It was delicious!!! The Veggie Fried Rice was good but I'm sure it would've been better with chicken or shrimp. 

Overall, we had a great experience at Firefox & CM Chicken. There's plenty of seating for people that want to dine in but I believe most order to go. If you're in the Grand Rapids area, definitely stop in and try their Korean fried chicken. You will not be disappointed!!!",real

Firefox&CMChicken,"Fire fox is a small authentic Korean restaurant that has a fairly big menu to choose from. I usually get the beef foxy Ramen and it's always delicious and hits the spot. You order and pay ahead up front and they bring you your food when it's ready and it never takes more than 10-15 mins which is awesome. If I go to Woodland Mall i'll always make sure to stop at Firefox. 
The only thing I don't like is that they only use disposable tableware which isn't always ideal to eat out of nor is it great for the environment but makes it really easy to take leftovers!!",real

Firefox&CMChicken,"It's great to have a Korean fried chicken place in GR! There's plenty of parking, ordering takes place when you walk in, and there's not too long of a wait to get your food. You can grab water while you wait or they have other Korean beverages for purchase. 

The chicken is well flavored and very crispy. I wasn't a big fan of the curry cheese ramen, which you could make yourself at home, so I'd stick to chicken next time. I also got a side of seaweed salad, which came in a styrofoam cup. There are metal chairs and ample seating inside if you dine in, but I'd definitely consider this for fried chicken takeout in the future!",real
Firefox&CMChicken,Pretty delicious stuff! I'll be back again for sure. The Spicy Garlic was solid but I want something a little hotter next time. The fry on the chicken was legit and the fried dumplings are really excellent with the sauce they pack them with. Service was fast and friendly.,real
Firefox&CMChicken,"Firefox has been a tried-and-true staple for us since we moved to Grand Rapids, and their menu has expanded impressively in that time! The interior is small but cozy, and the staff are always super friendly. We've liked everything we've ordered from here, but some of our favorites are the garlic soy chicken, curry cheese ramen, and beef bimbap. Definitely worth trying if you're looking for some delicious Korean takeout!",real

Service was fast and there's plenty of space with tables.",real

Firefox&CMChicken,"We've been to a CM chicken in VA and it was good so I got so excited when I saw that GR had CM Korean chicken! Wow.....We were blown away how amazing their food was...!!! 

All of their wings (Soy garlic, Curry and Garlic spicy) were so crispy and delicious. We would've been just so happy with that but they went above and beyond with their fried rice, fried shrimp, TTEOKBOKKI and fresh kimchi!!!!
I mean...I'm a sucker for good TteokBokki (Spicy rice cake+fish cake) and it was soooo good!!! 
That Mango lemonade was so yummy, too..!! 
Literally EVERYTHING WAS ON POINT and one more important thing...food came out really fast...! We were so surprised how fast it all came out. 

We actually gave our cash tips to the cook because we had to acknowledge her :) We got to speak with the owner & the manager. They were good/genuine people. I was so proud of them thriving in GR with Korean food. 

We'll be coming back soon! You should try this spot if you haven't yet! Absolutely worth it!!",real

Al-Bo’s,"I happened to be in the area for work and thought I'd give this place a try and I'm so glad I did! Such a nice little resturaunt,  with authentic  European cuisine. It is a Serbian restaurant,  but has many European dishes. The food brought back so many memories and I couldn't decide on just one thing,  so had to order to go as well. Home made Spätzle!! When they make it by hand you know the place is legit- even though its easy to make, many places use a boxed/bagged  version. A resturaunt that takes the time to make it by hand is a Gem. The Latte was just like one from the Austrian cafes. 
Also the nicest people work here. Run don't walk to here!!",real

Al-Bo’s,"I can't count the number of times I've driven past Al-Bo's and never stopped in. Looking to do something different, a friend and I went here for dinner after a round of golf. 

The menu was huge and it was a challenge getting through it all. Instead, I decided to just focus on two or three dishes that looked or sounded good and go from there. 

I had the goulash and my friend ordered the special which was lamb shank. Both were excellent. I especially liked the goulash sauce and the extremely favorable beef chunks. Fresh baked bread was served with both dishes which was great for lopping up the great goulash sauce! 

We also has a couple of lagers which were very good. I'm going to have to go back to get the name because I would definitely buy some for home. 

Service was quick and friendly. 

All in all, an enjoyable meal.",real

Service was like being a guest in someone's home....warm, inviting and very personal. Batsi was a wonderful guide for a newbie to Al-Bo's! 
The Sarma( sour cabbage rolls) were served piping hot with fluffy and light mashed potatoes and a flavorful sauce. We got a shopska salad to start and fresh bread as well. Also pictured is the grilled chicken sandwich for the guest still recovering from the flight . 
For dessert we got tufahije and baklava .... Light, flaky and chewy, just like it should be.  
After lunch we went to the little store next door to buy some goodies but we decided to come back to try the burek and pljeskavika and get our goodies then. 
So happy that we found this local place and had a chance to enjoy a lovely balkan meal.",real

Al-Bo’s,"If you're looking for a no-frills, genuinely good breakfast spot, this place hits the mark. It's one of my go-to favorites. The cappuccino? Easily one of the best I've had--seriously holds its own against any coffee shop. Everything here is about the small touches: perfectly toasted bread with a sprinkle of herbs, a simple omelet with fresh, crisp veggies cooked just right, and a great overall balance of flavor and portions. It's unassuming, but consistently excellent. Just give it a try--you'll see what I mean.",real
Al-Bo’s,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this establishment and was thoroughly impressed. The cappuccino crafted by Batsi was nothing short of phenomenal--rich, smooth, and expertly made. It rivaled any coffee shop brew I've had.

The meal was equally delightful. The stuffed cabbage paired with creamy mashed potatoes was hearty and flavorful, and the Greek salad was fresh and crisp. Portions were generous; I even had leftovers to enjoy later. Everything was so delicious, I completely forgot to take pictures!

Batsi's warm and friendly demeanor made the experience even more special. He guided me through the menu, helping me navigate the numerous tempting options to find the perfect meal. His hospitality made me feel right at home.

If I lived in Grand Rapids, this would undoubtedly be a regular spot for me. Highly recommend to anyone seeking delicious food and exceptional service.",real

The atmosphere was warm, inviting, and spacious. I ordered the lamb shank; with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. The meat easily fell off the bone, melted in my mouth, and paired perfectly with the potatoes and veggies. My friends opted for the Wiener Schnitzel and Paris Schnitzel, both of which they enjoyed. I also took the opportunity to meet the owner, with friends from his hometown and extended family. I will be back. Walla--thank you in Bosnian!",real

Al-Bo’s,"This one is a bit old but definitely still worth sharing. I've drove past this spot quite a few times and always wondered what it was. As it turns out, one of my friends loves this spot so we grabbed some dinner.

We both ordered a flatbread style dish - mine was stuffed with feta cheese and my friends got a ground beef version. These were my favorite at Al Bos. Flaky, buttery layers of dough with a savory filling. 

I got this massive platter of meats because I couldn't decide on anything. Honesty felt like a little kid ordering chicken tenders again. It wasn't particularly amazing but I enjoyed it. The skewer and patties were decent but a little greasy for my taste. The rice came out cold while some of the other items were blazing hot. Owner was nice and the place was clean and quiet. I'd go back again, especially for their baked items.",real
Al-Bo’s,"I've had Al-Bos on my list to try for ages, so when one of our go-to spots was too busy at dinner time, Nate and I decided to check it out. I'm trying to slowly go through my list of places I've never been in Grand Rapids!

I will say I think my expectations were a bit high from some of the reviews I've read. We sat in a cozy booth and were greeted by a friendly employee who was working the bar and waiting all the tables. It wasn't super busy but I had a feeling the service might be a bit slower. They do serve alcohol here but we stuck with water.

The menu has several photos and I knew I wanted to try the burek, which is a flaky pastry filled with cheese or cheese and meat. I did have to Google some names as there aren't many descriptions, and we asked our server for some recommendations. He suggested the burek with cheese and spinach, which wasn't listed on the menu. I asked which he liked better, the cevapi or the pljeskavica. I think he said they are basically the same meat mixture, one is in a sausage link form and the other is a burger-like patty. We went with the pljeskavica.

Once we got our food, we dug in and I noticed that everything was just lukewarm, not hot. I was a bit disappointed with that because I think the burek would have been better if it was warmer. It was still tasty, and I liked the addition of the spinach. The plate with the pljeskavica came with fries and a scoop of rice. The fries were definitely not hot and closer to room temperature, but we still ate them. The meat patty was seasoned well and was mixed with some minced onions. It was like eating a burger without a bun, which I didn't mind, but it didn't blow me away.

I'm glad we gave Al-Bos a try and I would go back to order some different dishes - the schnitzel sounds great and the mixed grill/combo platters might be a good way to try some other things. Definitely a unique restaurant and I'm glad we have this option in town.",real

Papa Chops Eatery,"Hello Lovelies. Got another review for you. My friend recommended me this place because we both have a gluten- free allergy. Papa Chops, is the place to try so many foods that we gluten free people can't have. For example I haven't had fish and chips in a long time. Guess what? They have it. Haven't had a good wrap? They have it. Check out their menu it is amazing. The fish and chips dipping sauce and tartar sauce was dairy free too. The service? So great, very homey and friendly as well as their ambiance. It's like a warm meal without the worries of allergies! And even if you don't have food restrictions the flavor is so good either way. So come on over to Papa Chops and enjoys (P.S.

Papa Chops Eatery,"Admittedly, this restaurant has come up as recommended for quite some time but I avoided it because the name (completely judgmental on my part) but last weekend we decided to try and we loved it!
The restaurant sits in a small strip mall but makes great use of the outside space by offering picnic tables by the woods.  All of the workers we dealt with were very kind and attentive, and more importantly the food was all gluten free and DELICIOUS!  
We ordered the Nashville hot chicken which was juicy and crispy and nicely seasoned.  The pickles were also fantastically crunchy and offered a nice crunch and the sauce was well portioned so it didn't overtake the bun or the meat.  The gluten free bun was fantastic (though just the bottom of the bun was weird crispy/spongy BUT for a gluten free bun it's the best I have had for a while.
We also had the Bull Rider burger which was juicy, well cooked and the BBQ sauce was smoky sweet.
Then we tried the onion rings (so crispy and seasoned well), the French fries (fantastic) and the mozzarella sticks which we both wanted to live in - honestly they had the perfect cheese pull and the marinara sauce and seasoned crust were fantastic.
The only con is that we don't live closer so we can go every day!",real
Papa Chops Eatery,My wife was looking forward to this place as she has gluten issues. Overall we were not impressed. Very expensive for what you get. Bluegill order serves only a few small pieces. Chicken sandwiches were both tough and stringy. Not good at all. One plus though was the onion rings as those were really good. Unfortunately this place is definitely not worth the cost. I'd possibly have gone 1 star if the onion rings weren't good.,real

Also tried the Mac and cheese with Pulled BBQ Pork on top- so good, just enough cheese and so creamy. Must try! 
The noodles are cooked perfectly and tasted really good.

I liked that there was lots of space for my toddler to comfortably run around while we waited for our food. I would consider this a family friendly restaurant due to the crayons & coloring pages available, space for all the kids to run around in the dining area, changing table available in the bathroom, and 2 high chairs available as well.

The sashimi was cut nice and thick and was presented nicely. Each app was flavorful and different than the other, so I was happy to taste each of them. The mango was freshly cut and diced too, which was excellent.

The unlimited lunch special is definitely the best value.

Appetizers were pretty small and underwhelming but good for the price. I'd recommend sticking to the fancier rolls if you decide to come here.

Many delicious options to choose from and we loved the bulgogi, dolsot bibimbap and the tofu stew. Banchan (the little Korean side dishes) came out with the meal and were delicious. Tofu stew is my favorite traditional Korean dish and while I wish they had more flavors besides seafood or the kimchi with the pork (prefer non kimchi) - this will do and still tastes great. 

Inside is clean and spacious. Very family friendly - They have high chairs, booster seats and women's bathroom has a changing table. Kids water cups too!

But what truly sets Pho Anh Trang apart is their full spectrum of offerings: desserts like chè ba màu, bánh bò nướng, and refreshing drinks like pennywort juice and traditional Vietnamese coffee. It's rare to find a place that delivers on both savory and sweet this well.

The service has always been excellent, but one experience really stood out. When I brought someone new to Vietnamese cuisine here, the owner was incredibly gracious and took time to help guide us through the dishes. That kind of thoughtful hospitality speaks volumes.

This isn't just a great Vietnamese restaurant for Michigan--it's one of the best Vietnamese dining experiences in the U.S. If you're within driving distance of Grand Rapids, make the trip. You won't regret it.",real

Pho Anh Trang Restaurant,"It's been two years since I moved to Austin, TX, and I still find it incredibly difficult to find pho that matches the quality of this place. Just last week, I visited Grand Rapids, MI, and within two hours of landing, I begged my friend to take me to this spot for lunch. The staff is always friendly (they're always open to moving your seat if you ask!), and the pho is reasonably priced (it's ALWAYS half off!).

My favorite item from their menu is their Vietnamese coffee. I've tried countless others in the past - from other pho restaurants to boba shops to coffee houses - but nothing comes close to theirs. They serve it in a glass cup with ice alongside a cup of condensed milk, while hot coffee drips into it. After a few minutes, you're left with one of the best Vietnamese coffees I've ever had.

And let's not forget about the pho itself - it's simply AMAZING! Even though I'm not the biggest pho fan, I always finish every last bit of their bowl. My go-to order is usually the rare beef and beef brisket, but I'm confident all their other pho selections are just as good.

This place has been a staple for me since my college days in Grand Rapids, MI. I'm just grateful that I can always return to it whenever I'm back in town :)",real

Pho Anh Trang Restaurant,"The Pho is always half off. It's hilarious until you try it. Then it's hilarious and irresistibly delicious. 

I've had a handful (or bowlful?) of pho's around GR, but this place has to be some of the best. Don't be surprised if there's a little kid running around playing with toys or a tv in the background blasting Vietnamese pop music videos - it's all part of the experience. 

My go-to pho spot, and it should be yours as well.",real
Pho Anh Trang Restaurant,"Visited this viet place while in town, and I was an instant fan. We ordered shrimp toast, bun bo hue, and house pho. Something that I noticed, the soup base for the 2 noodle soups are different, I can't say that about every pho locations. Prices are super reasonable, but portion size tends to be on the lower side, but that's ok, you can try more stuff from their menu!",real
Pho Anh Trang Restaurant,"Pho Anh Trang is hitting on every level. It's one of those places that you never want to leave. It has an old diner feel. Large open space, where you don't feel like you're standing over other people. The noise dampened by well aged booths and signature carpeting. Well broken in, but not dirty by any means, that's how you know you found a special spot. 

The pho broth will warm your soul. The perfect blank canvas to doctor it up with all the chili and fish sauce your heart desires.

I was unfamiliar with shrimp toast, but gave it a try anyway. I suggest you do the same if you haven't. The crunch and richness was a perfect break from the pho. 

Service was great! Very welcoming and attentive. Even packed up leftovers for us.",real

Our waitress was amazing, service with a smile and energy, directing my constant compliments to the cooks. 

Let's get to the food. I ordered the Breakfast Poutine (sub. bacon for the garlic mushrooms because I dislike the texture), and an Iced Chai Latte. Not only was the food visually appealing with lots of TLC clearly shown on the plate, but I can confidently say this was one of the best things I've eaten in my life and is now in my top 10.

Server was sitting on her phone in clear view of our table while we could also see our drinks waiting by the bar, ice melting and all. Are they not training staff? Is there no management?

I got the bang bang chicken sandwich and it might look like a hot mess (I accidentally cut the sandwich prior to taking the photo), but beware that it will make you want to devour it as quickly as possible. I would've liked the salad to be in a bowl or less lettuce as I felt like the lettuce was getting all over the place. The atmosphere was very pleasant.",real

The food is overall very tasty if you are a ""normal"" eater. My husband is particularly obsessed with the whiskey cake. Unfortunately, I am a ""funny tummy"" girlie, which means I avoid gluten.

Cindy's Donuts & Ice Cream,"He Said: I heard about the breakfast sandwich from the people at a nearby establishment when I was visiting the area a year ago, and I took their suggestion and when we returned to town this year, I had to come back and get another. It's just that good. The sandwich this time was served with donut holes, and those were tasty, too. It's definitely five stars from me. 

She Said: When He came back from Cindy's last year and raved about the breakfast sandwich, I was intrigued, but we didn't have time for a follow-up visit until this year. Maybe it was because of the hype going in, but I found it to be just another breakfast sandwich and not a Must Buy whenever we're in town. It would be 3 stars for me, mostly because I reserve the 4 and 5 stars for crave-worthy items or must-visit places.

Cindy's Donuts & Ice Cream,"Along a major street known for housing all of America's chain restaurants and stores, a local business like Cindy's Donuts and Ice Cream stands out. At the corner of East Paris and 28th Street is a slightly retro-style shop run by two friendly women. There's a large sign in front that looks like it was made in the 1960s and a lone picnic table sits nearby. 

The inside is spacious with tables in the front room and more in the back. When I went on a Tuesday morning, a group of elderly men were enjoying coffee and doughnuts at a corner table. 

Dozens of doughnuts line the display windows made fresh every morning. They have cake doughnuts, flour doughnuts, doughnut holes, etc. Most doughnuts are just over $1 per doughnut. I ordered a single chocolate frosted doughnut with sprinkles for $1.25 and the woman kindly included three glazed doughnut holes. Since my bill was under $5, they charged me an extra 50 cents, but it was worth it. That doughnut was delicious!

They also have around a dozen flavors of ice cream, but come for the doughnuts. This place is a hidden gem!",real

When you walk in, you get a table with menus, then you order at the bar and take a number to your table, then you bring your number up to the bar to pay when you're done. The service was very quick as well. The dining room was pretty busy and takeout orders were constant.

Our meals included rice, soup, and our choice of either an egg roll or 2 cheese rangoons. I'm not sure if this is everyday or just a Sunday thing, I don't think the menu mentioned this deal. 

The portions were very large and we both took boxes home. The prices were reasonable for EGR and the portions received.

The food was so good and affordable. We chose to do family style at our different tables so we had a great spread of food.

Gaslight Kitchen,"I came here after seeing so many rave reviews on Yelp! First thing I noticed is it is very small and simple yet still gives a semi elegant vibe giving 3 stars for ambiance. 

Service was interesting. They seated us then gave us a menu, took our drink orders without giving us an opportunity to look at what they offered then said to order at the counter when ready. I put our order in then took a number to my table that I would need to take back to the counter to pay. This is where I was a bit disappointed. There weren't very many people in the restaurant and there were 3 servers in a tiny place that could have provided table service. They did serve the food but overall I'd say the service is mediocre, 3 stars. 

Cleanliness gains 4 stars as there were multiple clean tables but we were seated at a dirty one that was wiped off after we sat down. Other than that it appeared to be very clean. 

Food quality and freshness. I do think the food was very good but honestly it wasn't anything special. With so many reviews saying they're the best Chinese in GR I think I had expectations for something special but it was just average. I'm going to give 5 stars for both of these though because it was very good. That's 4 stars total.",real
