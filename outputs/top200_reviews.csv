When I went, it was later and not super busy. Despite this, our server was very slow with getting to us for drinks and our food order wasn't taken for at least 30 minutes. We didn't end up getting our food until 50 minutes into our time there. Once the food did come, it was good! The beer cheese wasn't my favorite, but that's only because I'm a cheese snob!

Al-Bo’s,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this establishment and was thoroughly impressed. The cappuccino crafted by Batsi was nothing short of phenomenal--rich, smooth, and expertly made. It rivaled any coffee shop brew I've had. The meal was equally delightful. The stuffed cabbage paired with creamy mashed potatoes was hearty and flavorful, and the Greek salad was fresh and crisp. Portions were generous; I even had leftovers to enjoy later. Everything was so delicious, I completely forgot to take pictures! Batsi's warm and friendly demeanor made the experience even more special. He guided me through the menu, helping me navigate the numerous tempting options to find the perfect meal. His hospitality made me feel right at home. If I lived in Grand Rapids, this would undoubtedly be a regular spot for me.

Either way I had it in my head that I wanted a wrap and decided on the grilled chicken Caesar wrap with the recommended onion rings. Everything was so good, especially those onion rings with the sauce. Might be one of the best onion rings. The breading was crispy and flavorful. Unbelievable that it's a gluten free spot. I will definitely stop in again.",0.04971054301985783
Haludam,"Grand Rapids finally has a traditional Korean food restaurant that's an actual sit down restaurant! It's nice that it just focuses on traditional Korean food and doesn't try and cover BBQ/fried chicken/etc. Many delicious options to choose from and we loved the bulgogi, dolsot bibimbap and the tofu stew. Banchan (the little Korean side dishes) came out with the meal and were delicious. Tofu stew is my favorite traditional Korean dish and while I wish they had more flavors besides seafood or the kimchi with the pork (prefer non kimchi) - this will do and still tastes great. Inside is clean and spacious. Very family friendly - They have high chairs, booster seats and women's bathroom has a changing table. Kids water cups too! Servers were very kind and helpful. While this isn't California/Atlanta, this is the best Grand Rapids has to offer for traditional Korean food and we will definitely be back.",0.0496306356443624

Al-Bo’s,"I can't count the number of times I've driven past Al-Bo's and never stopped in. Looking to do something different, a friend and I went here for dinner after a round of golf. The menu was huge and it was a challenge getting through it all. Instead, I decided to just focus on two or three dishes that looked or sounded good and go from there. I had the goulash and my friend ordered the special which was lamb shank. Both were excellent. I especially liked the goulash sauce and the extremely favorable beef chunks. Fresh baked bread was served with both dishes which was great for lopping up the great goulash sauce! We also has a couple of lagers which were very good. I'm going to have to go back to get the name because I would definitely buy some for home. Service was quick and friendly. All in all, an enjoyable meal.",0.044066778413938586
Al-Bo’s,"I've had Al-Bos on my list to try for ages, so when one of our go-to spots was too busy at dinner time, Nate and I decided to check it out. I'm trying to slowly go through my list of places I've never been in Grand Rapids! I will say I think my expectations were a bit high from some of the reviews I've read. We sat in a cozy booth and were greeted by a friendly employee who was working the bar and waiting all the tables. It wasn't super busy but I had a feeling the service might be a bit slower. They do serve alcohol here but we stuck with water. The menu has several photos and I knew I wanted to try the burek, which is a flaky pastry filled with cheese or cheese and meat. I did have to Google some names as there aren't many descriptions, and we asked our server for some recommendations. He suggested the burek with cheese and spinach, which wasn't listed on the menu. I asked which he liked better, the cevapi or the pljeskavica. I think he said they are basically the same meat mixture, one is in a sausage link form and the other is a burger-like patty. We went with the pljeskavica. Once we got our food, we dug in and I noticed that everything was just lukewarm, not hot. I was a bit disappointed with that because I think the burek would have been better if it was warmer. It was still tasty, and I liked the addition of the spinach. The plate with the pljeskavica came with fries and a scoop of rice. The fries were definitely not hot and closer to room temperature, but we still ate them. The meat patty was seasoned well and was mixed with some minced onions. It was like eating a burger without a bun, which I didn't mind, but it didn't blow me away. I'm glad we gave Al-Bos a try and I would go back to order some different dishes - the schnitzel sounds great and the mixed grill/combo platters might be a good way to try some other things. Definitely a unique restaurant and I'm glad we have this option in town.",0.04402818545725479

The unlimited lunch special is definitely the best value. Appetizers were pretty small and underwhelming but good for the price. I'd recommend sticking to the fancier rolls if you decide to come here. Service was fine, nothing over the top. Inside was tad bit dirty and the menus were really greasy which was off-putting.

Haludam,"I'm very excited that there's another korean restaurant in town! I stopped by with a friend for the last day of their soft opening and it was packed! (rightfully so) The ambiance is great and honestly with all of the restaurant seating taken up, it was not loud at all. The workers and owners were very kind and very attentive. Additionally the food came out very quick, considering that they mentioned they have been struggling with keeping up with getting orders out. I myself ordered the hot stone bibimbap, some of the menu options were out of stock from the previous soft opening days. The food was great and came with 3 different side dishes. The only thing that docked some points for me was the portion size that came out, the hot stone bibimbap(beef) was $19 and honestly there was not much beef along side the small portion in my opinion.

The menu was pretty decent, and for $29, I was excited. The waitress was excellent and helped me to get some quick appetizers and a beverage within 5 minutes of sitting down. I had all three apps from the menu along with a salad, followed by a nice sampling of sashimi and then 3 rolls and a little ice cream. Not a thing ordered disappointed me! The sashimi was cut nice and thick and was presented nicely. Each app was flavorful and different than the other, so I was happy to taste each of them. The mango was freshly cut and diced too, which was excellent. The three rolls I got were packed full of flavor, and my favorite was the Hellfire, followed by the Crunchy Crab. I wish I had room for more because there were so many to choose from. In the end, I will definitely be back again soon and hope the next experience will be even better!",0.0367332885465789

We chose to do family style at our different tables so we had a great spread of food. The spices were great in the food and I was so excited to take food home too! Also, they have a full bar, so if you would like to drink there, it's an option too! We didn't drink there but we did get the Vietnamese coffee and they brewed it fresh! It was so good! Lastly, shoutout to the staff. Their service was great! We came in with 12 people and they were very helpful with our questions and accommodating us.

However wonderful the food is, my biggest compliments are to our cheery, professional server named Taren. She went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect. The big question we should ask ourselves, why not eat here instead of the chick-filet next door?! It's only a few dollars more, and actually probably cheaper because of the massive servings given -and probably just as fast!",0.03454780873641321
Firefox&CMChicken,"It's great to have a Korean fried chicken place in GR! There's plenty of parking, ordering takes place when you walk in, and there's not too long of a wait to get your food. You can grab water while you wait or they have other Korean beverages for purchase. The chicken is well flavored and very crispy. I wasn't a big fan of the curry cheese ramen, which you could make yourself at home, so I'd stick to chicken next time. I also got a side of seaweed salad, which came in a styrofoam cup. There are metal chairs and ample seating inside if you dine in, but I'd definitely consider this for fried chicken takeout in the future!",0.03432304200313048
Visit Detroit,I'm so appreciative of having a korean fried chicken and waffles which had a feeling the service was like eating a burger like patty.

As it turns out, one of my friends loves this spot so we grabbed some dinner. We both ordered a flatbread style dish - mine was stuffed with feta cheese and my friends got a ground beef version. These were my favorite at Al Bos. Flaky, buttery layers of dough with a savory filling. I got this massive platter of meats because I couldn't decide on anything. Honesty felt like a little kid ordering chicken tenders again. It wasn't particularly amazing but I enjoyed it. The skewer and patties were decent but a little greasy for my taste. The rice came out cold while some of the other items were blazing hot. Owner was nice and the place was clean and quiet. I'd go back again, especially for their baked items.",0.03385233849595439

Papa Chops Eatery,"Hello Lovelies. Got another review for you. My friend recommended me this place because we both have a gluten- free allergy. Papa Chops, is the place to try so many foods that we gluten free people can't have. For example I haven't had fish and chips in a long time. Guess what? They have it. Haven't had a good wrap? They have it. Check out their menu it is amazing. The fish and chips dipping sauce and tartar sauce was dairy free too. The service? So great, very homey and friendly as well as their ambiance. It's like a warm meal without the worries of allergies! And even if you don't have food restrictions the flavor is so good either way. So come on over to Papa Chops and enjoys (P.S. I did forget to take a picture because I was so excited to try the food. Oh well, guess I'll have to come back next time to take more pictures for you guys.)",0.03343691101512132

Papa Chops Eatery,"Admittedly, this restaurant has come up as recommended for quite some time but I avoided it because the name (completely judgmental on my part) but last weekend we decided to try and we loved it! The restaurant sits in a small strip mall but makes great use of the outside space by offering picnic tables by the woods. All of the workers we dealt with were very kind and attentive, and more importantly the food was all gluten free and DELICIOUS! We ordered the Nashville hot chicken which was juicy and crispy and nicely seasoned. The pickles were also fantastically crunchy and offered a nice crunch and the sauce was well portioned so it didn't overtake the bun or the meat. The gluten free bun was fantastic (though just the bottom of the bun was weird crispy/spongy BUT for a gluten free bun it's the best I have had for a while. We also had the Bull Rider burger which was juicy, well cooked and the BBQ sauce was smoky sweet. Then we tried the onion rings (so crispy and seasoned well), the French fries (fantastic) and the mozzarella sticks which we both wanted to live in - honestly they had the perfect cheese pull and the marinara sauce and seasoned crust were fantastic.

Pho Anh Trang Restaurant,"It's been two years since I moved to Austin, TX, and I still find it incredibly difficult to find pho that matches the quality of this place. Just last week, I visited Grand Rapids, MI, and within two hours of landing, I begged my friend to take me to this spot for lunch. The staff is always friendly (they're always open to moving your seat if you ask!), and the pho is reasonably priced (it's ALWAYS half off!). My favorite item from their menu is their Vietnamese coffee. I've tried countless others in the past - from other pho restaurants to boba shops to coffee houses - but nothing comes close to theirs. They serve it in a glass cup with ice alongside a cup of condensed milk, while hot coffee drips into it. After a few minutes, you're left with one of the best Vietnamese coffees I've ever had. And let's not forget about the pho itself - it's simply AMAZING! Even though I'm not the biggest pho fan, I always finish every last bit of their bowl. My go-to order is usually the rare beef and beef brisket, but I'm confident all their other pho selections are just as good.

Pho Anh Trang Restaurant,"Best Vietnamese Food in America--Period. Pho Anh Trang has been my go-to Vietnamese restaurant since 2014. I've returned many times--2016, 2018, 2021--and every visit reminds me why this place stands out. The food is consistently phenomenal, the service is warm and welcoming, and the atmosphere feels like home. Their pho is outstanding--deep, rich broth with perfect cuts of meat, and their spring rolls and bún thịt nướng chả giò never miss. But what truly sets Pho Anh Trang apart is their full spectrum of offerings: desserts like chè ba màu, bánh bò nướng, and refreshing drinks like pennywort juice and traditional Vietnamese coffee. It's rare to find a place that delivers on both savory and sweet this well. The service has always been excellent, but one experience really stood out. When I brought someone new to Vietnamese cuisine here, the owner was incredibly gracious and took time to help guide us through the dishes. That kind of thoughtful hospitality speaks volumes. This isn't just a great Vietnamese restaurant for Michigan--it's one of the best Vietnamese dining experiences in the U.S. If you're within driving distance of Grand Rapids, make the trip. You won't regret it.",0.03035551976503902
